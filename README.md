### Coding Challenge

Using the Mural Pay API Sandbox Environment, create a single-page application that allows a user to create an account and execute a payment. More specifically, the application should allow for
1. Customer & account creation
2. Payout request creation
3. Payout request execution
4. Viewing payout requests and their statuses for a given account
5. Integrates with one other public API of your choosing. It can be anything!
